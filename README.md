# LHASA app

Assess *rainfall-triggered landslide risk* with an easy-to-use web app.
Explore a global landslide risk map!

## Getting Started

To spin up your own instance of the app, you can use `Docker`:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The app is available at `localhost:3000`. That's it! ðŸš€

> [!TIP]
> There is no need to manually manage data. By default, the latest predictions 
> are fetched, so up-to-date information is automatically available!

## Tools

The LHASA app is split into two main components, backend and frontend.

- **Backend**: An API (FastAPI) that fetches and manages the LHASA predictions.
  It dynamically serves the predictions as tiles.
- **Frontend**: A Next.js app that displays the maps and provides a user
  interface.
